# LLM_Hackathon_2024
This repo contains code and data of our contribution to the 2024 LLM Hackathon, materials' property prediction from textual descriptions of structures and their bonding properties.

We generated textual descriptions of the 1264 structures of the [MatBench phonon dataset](https://matbench.materialsproject.org/Leaderboards%20Per-Task/matbench_v0.1_matbench_phonons/).
These descriptions were generated both with [Robocrystallographer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/robocrystallographer/index.html),
describing structural features as structure type, coordination environments etc. and [LobsterPy](https://jageo.github.io/LobsterPy/),
describing covalent bonding features of the structure like ICOHP values. The bonding database was
generated by A. Naik et al. and is publicly [available](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02477-5).

These textual descriptions of 1264 structures were then transformed into LLM prompts (see schema) by 
defining 
- **an Instruction**
  - 'What is the frequency of the highest frequency optical phonon mode peak in 
  units of 1/cm given the following description?'
- **an Input**
  - LobsterPy + Robocrys description of structure
- **a Response**
  - 'The frequency of the highest frequency optical phonon mode peak is 350.5858 1/cm.'


We finetuned a Llama 3 model using [un_sloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth?tab=readme-ov-file) (one train/test/val split: 0.64/0.2/0.16) and trained it for 10 epochs
with a validation step after each epoch. The textual output was converted back into
numerical frequency values for computation of MAEs and RMSEs.
The best epoch yields a test MAE of 37 1/cm. This performance is comparable to other models of
the [MatBench test suite](https://matbench.materialsproject.org/Leaderboards%20Per-Task/matbench_v0.1_matbench_phonons/).


--------------------
#### Project structure
The folder *Data_generation* contains code and data to create the LLM instructions, inputs and responses.
Please note that only the Robocrys text data is generated from scratch there, the raw LobsterPy data and targets
can be found [elsewhere](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02477-5).

The folder *Models* contains utilities and scripts to finetune a Llama 3 model for materials property prediction 
and evaluate the output.

The environment used for data generation can be build from *requirements_robocrys.txt*.
The environment used for LLM finetuning can be build from *environment_llm.yml* 
(we followed the [un_sloth installation instructions](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth?tab=readme-ov-file) here).
